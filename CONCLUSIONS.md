# Project Conclusions and Findings

## Executive Summary
Eniac, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, is exploring an expansion into the Brazilian market. This analysis evaluates Magist, a Brazilian software service company, as a potential partner for Eniac’s entry into Brazil. The goal was to assess whether Magist’s portfolio, delivery network, and overall capabilities align with Eniac’s needs for high-end tech products, fast delivery times, and scalability.

## Key Findings

### 1. **Misalignment in Product Market Fit**
   - **Eniac’s Product Portfolio**: Eniac offers high-end, Apple-compatible tech accessories, a niche market focused on premium electronics.
   - **Magist’s Product Portfolio**: Magist primarily works with small and medium-sized stores, and its portfolio is **heavily skewed towards non-tech products**. Only **1% of the products** sold through Magist are expensive tech products, while **71.9% are lower-priced tech items**. This indicates a misalignment with Eniac’s high-end tech focus.
   - **Conclusion**: Magist’s portfolio does not align with Eniac’s business model. This could hinder Eniac’s efforts to penetrate the Brazilian market with premium products.

### 2. **Delivery Issues**
   - **Delivery Times**: The average delivery time through Magist’s network has been relatively consistent, but the **12-day average** may not meet customer expectations, especially when fast shipping is critical in e-commerce. 
   - **Brazilian Customer Expectations**: A significant portion of Brazilian consumers abandon their online purchases due to **long delivery times** (44%). With **52% preferring local e-commerce** sites, fast and reliable delivery is essential for a successful market entry.
   - **Conclusion**: Magist’s delivery times may be too slow to meet the fast-paced expectations of Brazilian consumers, posing a risk for Eniac’s reputation and customer satisfaction.

### 3. **Lack of Relevant High-End Tech Product Platforms**
   - **Platform Access**: Magist lacks access to specialized platforms for Apple-compatible products, which are central to Eniac’s catalog. This further diminishes the alignment between the two companies.
   - **Conclusion**: Without access to platforms that cater specifically to high-end tech products, Magist would not be able to help Eniac reach its target customer base effectively.

### 4. **Market Dynamics**
   - **São Paulo Focus**: A significant portion (61.4%) of Magist’s tech product sales comes from São Paulo. Therefore, a **localized expansion** starting in São Paulo would allow Eniac to test the market with minimal risk, before deciding whether to scale further.
   - **Conclusion**: Targeting São Paulo for a localized market entry makes strategic sense, given that it represents a substantial portion of tech product sales.

### 5. **Brand Awareness and Customer Trust**
   - **Brand Reputation**: There is no clear indication whether Magist already sells Apple products or how they market high-end tech items. Additionally, there was a **drastic decrease in customer base from August to September 2018**, which raises concerns about the consistency of Magist’s services.
   - **Conclusion**: The lack of brand awareness and the inconsistent customer base are red flags that should be addressed before proceeding with a long-term partnership.

## Final Recommendation

Based on the findings, **it is not advisable for Eniac to sign a 3-year contract with Magist** as their exclusive partner for the Brazilian market. The key reasons for this recommendation include:
- Misalignment of Magist’s product portfolio with Eniac’s premium tech offerings.
- Concerns about Magist’s delivery times, which may not meet Brazilian consumer expectations.
- Lack of access to specialized platforms for high-end Apple-compatible products.
- Inconsistent customer behavior and brand awareness issues.

### Alternative Strategy
Rather than signing a full contract with Magist, it is recommended that Eniac **focus on localized expansion**, starting with São Paulo. This would allow the company to test the market in a concentrated region before scaling up. This strategy also offers flexibility in choosing other potential delivery partners or platforms that are more aligned with Eniac’s premium product line.

## Next Steps
- Evaluate other potential logistics partners that offer faster delivery times and better integration with high-end tech product platforms.
- Consider building brand awareness through targeted marketing campaigns in São Paulo.
- Monitor and evaluate the performance in São Paulo before expanding to other regions in Brazil.
